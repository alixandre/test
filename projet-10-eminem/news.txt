The rapper Eminem struck out at President Trump in a video that played at the BET Hip Hop<br>
Awards on Tuesday, accusing the president of racism, hypocrisy,<br> 
disrespect of military veterans and more in almost five minutes of furious freestyle rap.



Eminem is expressing his views on President Donald Trump with help from a newly released freestyle rap.<br>

In a taped segment that aired tonight on the 2017 BET Hip Hop Awards, <br>
the Grammy winner appeared in a downtown Detroit parking garage <br>
where he voiced his disapproval towards the Commander in Chief.<br>

"When he attacks the NFL so we focus on that / Instead of talking Puerto Rico 
or gun reform for Nevada," he raps. <br>
"All these horrible tragedies and he's bored and would rather / Cause a twitter storm with the Packers."<br>

Eminem continues, "Then says he wants to lower our taxes / <br>
Then who's gonna pay for his extravagant trips / Back and forth with fam to his golf resorts and mansions?"
